Qui√©n Manda is a map of power relations in Spain, combining network visualizations, investigative journalism articles and annotated photos. The code is stable and has been [live](http://quienmanda.es) since October 2013, but some important features are still missing:

 * Embeddable content
 
 * Richer network visualization
 
 * Custom visualizations
 
 * REST API

 * User generated content

### Currently working on...

We're using a [Waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/civio/quienmanda.es) to show which issues we're working on at the moment: we select a coherent set of issues from Backlog and move them into the 'Next milestone' column; once all the issues move to the Done column we go back to the Backlog and repeat the process. We aim to have a series of meaningful milestones (or iterations) forming a sensible high-level roadmap.

### Setting it up

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Using production content in your local environment
